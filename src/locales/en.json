I've spent the last few years building projects with modern stacks like React, TypeScript, and Node.js, always aiming for that sweet spot between clean code and a smooth user experience.",
    "description_2": "I like making things that are useful, intuitive, and sometimes just for fun (because why not?). Whether it's a SaaS platform, a mobile app, or a little side project that got out of hand, I love bringing concepts to life and learning something new along the way. Currently exploring backend architecture, system design, and a bit of mobile development too.",
